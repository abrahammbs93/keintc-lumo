## Introduction

Quarto is probably my favorite tool in the R/Python universe. Transforming your code and thoughts into a stunning report in one click always blows my mind.

While the default Quarto appearance **looks great**, there are [a few tweaks](https://www.productive-r-workflow.com/quarto-tricks) I always apply to elevate the report even further. Rather than manually adding them each time, I bundled everything into a custom format called `lumo`.

Btw, you can learn how to master Quarto thanks to my online course: [Productive R Workflow](https://www.productive-r-workflow.com)

This document aims at showcasing how a quarto document made with the `lumo` format looks like.
